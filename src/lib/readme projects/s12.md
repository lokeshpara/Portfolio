## Technical Concepts

### 1. Channels and Feature Extraction
- **Channels**: Input/output features extracted by kernels in convolution layers
- **Feature Maps**: Visual representation of extracted features
- **Multi-channel Processing**: Handling multiple input channels (e.g., RGB images)

### 2. Kernels (Filters)
- **Purpose**: Feature detectors that extract specific patterns from input data
- **Types of Operations**:
  - Edge detection
  - Blurring
  - Sharpening
  - Feature enhancement
- **Mathematical Representation**: 
  ```
  Y = (W1×A1) + (W2×A2) + (W3×A3) + ... + (W9×A9)
  ```
  where W represents kernel weights and A represents input values

### 3. Kernel Size Optimization
- **3×3 Kernel Benefits**:
  - Optimal parameter count (9 parameters)
  - Efficient computation
  - Balanced feature detection
  - Memory efficient
- **Why Not 2×2**:
  - Limited feature detection capability
  - Cannot detect center features effectively
  - Insufficient for complex pattern recognition

### 4. Convolution Operations
- **Size Reduction**: 
  - 199×199 → 1×1 requires 100 3×3 convolution operations
  - Each operation reduces size by 2 pixels
- **Mathematical Progression**:
  ```
  199×199 → 197×197 → 195×195 → ... → 3×3 → 1×1
  ```
